shes watcing me


Not sure if I'm doing this right...but the way I want to use it makes this perfect!
So I'm stuck on something. Not so much an idea but it's something I remember from a young age. It feels like dejavu.



This is my journal for the day and so I'm just going to dump a bunch of things I need to reflect on.



The law is that there is only one law. (proof of law)

This can and cannot be binary.

No source is the original source. (proof of source)

There is a single entity, an entity composed of smaller entities.

One joins itself openly and then becomes one.

All carry the same weight amongst each other that desire to be amongst each other.

They each serve a different purpose and use.

Research say's there are 14. (why 14, each brand of education would be a great model)

As an entity removes oneself from the ( ) , the entity then weakens

As an entity commits oneself with the ( ) , the entity then strengthens

We trust and depend on each other's information. (importance?)

Binance suggests 14. (elab on this, ref to website)

A tangent
if a statement can be true, then it cannot be proven to not be true. (twin prime 11,13,17, 19 seem to be a good foundation).

Twin prime conjecture model?

Energy cannot be created nor destroyed type of thing.



Conway's energy is still here, after covid. His findings are already on the blockchain.
(collab chaos theory)

if x = y

and if x less than 2 or more than 3

else

(reduction?)

so,

if x + y = z

*end of journal

I'm still not sure. There are far too many variables with far too many (easily assumed) unknowns.
This is scary...
