i don't understand why there's white and black, zero and one, hot and cold, good and bad, centralized and decentralized

are we the ones pushing technology and human life forward still?

because if we believe something is for good, we will do it right?

if i sacrifice sleep and time for rest to study more about the future, am i hurting myself or others?

it feels like im not supposed to be asking these type of questions. im a bit spooked.

am i crazy or is this some infinite circle of binary life that doesnt make something true or not true without knowing the other side of the story, better than that individual....

this is blockchain all over....im supposed to write code....its like nature is telling me to. this is freakin weird.
